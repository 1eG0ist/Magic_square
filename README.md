# Magic_square (C#)
A magic square of any dimension(equal sum of digits across rows, columns and two diagonals)

You enter number.

The program generates a matrix of any dimension from 1 to 1000, excluding 2.
Occurs by splitting the problem into 3 possible branches: 

  n - odd (Siamese method), 

  n - multiple of 2, but not multiple of 4,

  n - multiple of 2 and multiple of 4.
