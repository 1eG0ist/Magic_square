# Magic_square
A magic square of any dimension(equal sum of digits across rows, columns and two diagonals)

Matrix generation of any dimension from 1 to 1000, excluding 2. 
Occurs by splitting the problem into 3 possible branches: 
  n - odd (Siamese method), 
  n - multiple of 2, but not multiple of 4, 
  n - multiple of 2 and multiple of 4.
